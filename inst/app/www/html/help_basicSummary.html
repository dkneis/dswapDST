<p>
This interface allows a summary table to be filtered and sorted.
</p>

<p>
To filter the table to data of interest, click into the box displayed below a column header. Depending on the column type, you can either select from a set of values or enter a search string. In the latter case, only records matching the entered (sub)string will be shown.
</p>

<p>
To sort results, use the triangle symbols displayed next to the column headers.
