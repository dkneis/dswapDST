The SQL interface
</p>

<p>
This interface allows SQL 'select' queries to be executed on the database. Refer to the relationship model shown at the bottom of the page to formulate your query. Note that, for security reasons, the allowed set of characters in SQL select statements was reduced to a minimum. Consequently, even some very common queries will not run. 
</p>

<p>
Enter the SQL query string into the form and click the submit button. Tabular output resulting from the query will be displayed below the form. In case of an incorrect query, the respective error message will be displayed.
</p>

<p>
A set of sample queries can be found below. It is recommended to develop new queries in a local text editor so as to prevent a loss of work in case of network problems or other issues.
