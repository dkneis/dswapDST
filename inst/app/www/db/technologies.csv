CAS_A,"WWTP Terrassa is located approximately 21 km of Barcelona (Spain) and it has a total treatment capacity of 277,000 equivalent inhabitants. Wastewater treated is a mixture of municipal and industrial wastewater (mostly pharmaceutical and textile industry). The treatment consists of a pre-treatment, preliminary treatment, primary sedimentation unit and a secondary (biological) treatment. Pre-treated wastewater goes through a physical process of settling in a primary clarifier. 
influent: consists of a pre-denitrification (anaerobic) and nitrification
(aerobic) tank, and two secondary clarifiers. 

Some activated sludge from the secondary sedimentation unit is returned to the inlet of the primary clarifier, whereas the remaining fraction of secondary sludge is being combined with the primary sludge and further treated (i.e., thickened, dewatered and anaerobically digested). In the anaerobic digester, the biosolids are stabilized during approximately 30 days period at 34 °C. The treated sludge is then shipped from the WWTP for the direct application to agricultural fields.",CAS
CAS_B,"The two WWTP systems (activated sludge and MF/RO) investigated are in combination and together form the largest WWTP in the region servicing approximately 700 000 people with an average dry weather flow of 140 ML day?1. Secondary treatment (i.e., CAS treatment) with a bioreactor only. Preliminary treatment included a inlet screen, grit removal and primary settling tank. Influent flow characteristics of this plant are domestically dominated (>85%). However, this proportion decreases substantially (to 57%) when analysing biological oxygen demand (BOD) of influent, with a variety of industrial effluents to note including food manufacture/processing (15%), hospitality (10%), hospitals (3%), and motor industry (3%) wastes. The MF/RO plant receives approximately 10% of effluent flow from the conventional plant for supply to a local oil refinery. ",CAS
CAS_C,"Raw sewage from the Tel-Aviv (Israel) WWTP served as the feed, after sedimentation and 800 ?m filtration, for the MBR. The MBR included a bioreactor that was divided into three zones (anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic) to enhance the removal of organic compounds and nutrients. Bioreactor output was filtered in a membrane tank by two Zenon ZeeWeed 500 UF immersed hollow fiber membranes (total area of 2 m2), in a flux range of 10–20 lmh, at a pressure range of 10–24 kPa and with 10 g/L mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS). While the MBR was operated continuously, the RO was operated as a semi-batching device in which, the feed tank had a definite volume and its content was concentrated continuously by the return of the RO concentrate to be filtered again (see Fig. 1). The recovery rate increased over time, with a negligible temperature increase due to the relatively short period of time for each experiment and the permeate was sampled when the recovery reached the desired level of 80–90% according to the test requirements. The RO membrane type was Filmtec TW30 25–40 with 2.7 m2 surface area, and a flux range of 22–31 lmh at a pressure range of 9.5–10.2 bar.

The facility consists of primary clarification for removal of settleable solids; activated sludge treatment (sludge age of 12 days and mixed liquor suspended solids concentration of 3200 mg/L) to achieve removal of biochemical oxygen-demanding organic compounds (BOD), nitrogen, and phosphorus; and secondary clarification. Flow then splits, with about 5% going to a second clarification tank after ferric chloride addition, followed by granular media filtration. The remaining 95% of the flow goes to submerged membrane microfiltration units. The flow is then combined and passes on to GAC adsorption beds (Calgon F-400) with an empty bed contact time of 15 min. The beds were in place for about three years at the time this study began. It was assumed that they were essentially exhausted with respect to adsorption capacity other than capacity produced by bio-regeneration.

Different amounts of H2O2 added to the system may have different effect on the removal efficiencies (Cai and Hu 2017, Polo-López et al. 2014).

UF_G,"Wastewater collected downstream of the activated sludge system, in a UWTP situated in Cyprus (designed capacity=272000 population equivalents, inhabitants served=151000, average flow=21480 m3/ day), was used as feed solution for the UF experiments (quoted as CAS effluent).ÊAn ultrafiltration pilot plant located at the University of Cyprus campus was used for the implementation of the UF experiments. The pilot plant is comprised of four parallel ultrafiltration PVDF polymeric tubular hollow-fibre membranes that operate in batch mode (KOCH, Germany, model: ABCOR¨ FEG plus module 10-HFM-251-PVI). The membranesÕ charge is neutral, the nominal pore diameter is 0.03 _m, while the effective membrane surface area is 0.2 m2. The MWCO of the UF membranes is 100 kDa, while the treatment capacity of the UF-pilot unit is 1 m3/day. The UF plant is equipped with a 200 L stainless-steel feed tank to store and deliver the wastewater to the system. A pressure pump (GRUNDFOS, 2.2 kW) is used to supply the feed liquid through the membranes. The filtered wastewater flows directly from the membranes to the permeate tank, whereas the concentrate returns to the feed tank, while recirculating. The filtration technique applied to the pilot unit is the cross-flow filtration (also known as tangential-flow filtration). At the beginning of the UF experiments, the feed tank was filled with 100 L of CAS effluents. Then, a predetermined volume of each of the stock solution of the antibiotics was added to the wastewater effluent (100 _g L-1 for each of the antibiotics in the wastewater). The target antibiotics were detected at very low concentrations in the CAS effluents using UPLC/MS-MS, therefore their inherent concentration was regarded as negligible. During the loading of the feed tank with the antibiotics, the feed pump which transfers the effluents to the system, was in the off mode, to avoid any loss of antibiotic compounds through adsorption onto the membranes. After homogenization (mixed manually), a sample was taken and analysed. The measured concentration represented the initial antibiotic concentration in the feed wastewater. Then, the filtration experiments began, ran for 20 min, and ended when the 100 L starting volume was reduced to 50 L as concentrate (volumetric concentration factor (VCF) of 2) and 50 L of permeate was generated. The permeate flow rate was 2.5 L min__ 1.Ê",UF
